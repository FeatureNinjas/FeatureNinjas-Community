# Welcome Ninja!

This is the repository to track issues for FeatureNinjas SaaS. We have an agile and open mindset and therefore openly share our bugs and features that we work on with you.

You want to define what feature comes next? Head over to our Trello board at https://trello.com/b/OhatDfJ3/fn-dev and vote for the features that are important to you. You can even add comments if you feel that something is missing.

If you want to suggest new features, add an issue here in the repository with the label "enhancement". We will then move it to Trello. Moved suggestions will be closed and furthermore tracked in the Trello Board.

> **Why are we using Trello instead of GitHub Projects?**
> Because Trello allows you to vote on cards. This helps us to prioritze directly based on your feedback.

For bug reports, create issues in this repository as you know from other GitHub projects.
